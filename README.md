# 👋 Hi, I'm Saddam Hossen

**WordPress Plugin Developer | WooCommerce Extensions & Performance Solutions**

I build custom WordPress plugins that solve real business problems—from WooCommerce extensions 
to complex integrations and performance optimization tools.

With 7+ years of development experience, I focus on clean, scalable code that businesses can 
rely on for the long term.
