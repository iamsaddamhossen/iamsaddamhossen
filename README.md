# 👋 Hi, I'm Saddam Hossen

**WordPress Plugin Developer | WooCommerce Extensions & Performance Solutions**

I build custom WordPress plugins that solve real business problems — from WooCommerce extensions  
to complex integrations and performance optimization tools.

With 8+ years of development experience, I focus on clean, scalable code that businesses can  
rely on for the long term.
